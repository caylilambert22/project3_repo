Project 3: Create a fully operational web application for managing "to-do" lists using React.

Details: The functionality offered is the ability to add tasks to a table at the home screen. Then as the task is completed, you can mark it so from the table. You can also add in a contact.

Tech: HTML, CSS, Javascript

Improvement: For future improvement, I would like to play around with adding more filter options and form fields that allow the user to be more specific in their task management. 

User Stories:

1) Users should be able to navigate easily and efficiently to set up their tasks
2) Users should be able to add a task and edit that same task. They should also be allowed to delete it cleanly from the table.
3) Users should be able to submit their information for contact and be prompted back to the original page to continue their tasks.
